## 1: Assume that we can perform ten million tests of the above kind each second on our computer. How long would it take to factor a 25 digit number (with two prime factors both of the same order (12 digit numbers))?

$10^{12} / 10^{7} = 10^{5} = 27.777 hour$

## 2: How much faster does your improved trial division algorithm become for 25 digit numbers? Roughly how much storage does your algorithm require? What kind of budget does the storage require-ment demand; student budget, big government grant, more dollars than there are atoms in the universe? You may check current storage pricing on http://www.prisjakt.nu.

Number of primes $<10^{12}$ is aporox. $x/ln(x) = 10^{12}/ln(10^{12}) = 3.6*10^{11}$. (??)

$3.6*10^{11} / 10^{7} = 3.6*10^{4} = 1 hour$
